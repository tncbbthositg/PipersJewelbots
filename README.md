One of these days, we'll put more information in here. :)

All of this stuff is free.  However, the code in WarEagle, our "music player," may not be used
to play Rammer Jammer, Yea Alabama, or any of that other vile Crimson Tide stuff!

If you do anything cool or you're inspired by anything, please let us know!

Finally, if you have any trouble with any of it, feel free to let us know.

Piper and Patrick


Oh, actually finally, none of this is particularly robust.  Don't expect peak performance.  Also,
expect a presence of bugs, defects, and code smells.  :)
